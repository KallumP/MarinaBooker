General:

make sure that all inputs are number values

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a constant size)

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

store the start and ends in the order as string aswell as the start and end index

test interval finding
use up the first few months
use up the last few months
use up months in the middle



Simulation:

Remove boats all boats that need to leave, before adding any new boats

Output the length left per month

Have LinkedList.AddItem() take in a boat, and in that method, push back a new ListItem(passed in boat)
this is for memory management
