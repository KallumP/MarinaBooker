General:

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a constant size)

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

store the start and ends in the order as string aswell as the start and end index

test interval finding
use up the first few months
use up the last few months
use up multiple months in the middle
use one 150m length boat to fill up a month

Turn the date to index method into a static one in the timestamp class
make a reverse version, that turns an index into a date
reflect this change of methods in the class diagram

boat inheritance

have a Â£ before the cost

Simulation:

Output the length left per month

Report:

I've made the time table be 24 months long
Justify the reason for using a struct

Justify not exiting the booking when a wrong input was entered

I don't write to the file when terminating the program, but instead when the order if finished
this way, if the application is closed incorrectly, the user does not loose all their data
