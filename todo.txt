General:

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a constant size)

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

store the start and ends in the order as string aswell as the start and end index

test interval finding
use up the first few months
use up the last few months
use up multiple months in the middle
use one 150m length boat to fill up a month

Turn the date to index method into a static one in the timestamp class


Simulation:

Turn the linked list to be dynamic

set ListItems attributes back to private (after testing deletes)

Output the length left per month
