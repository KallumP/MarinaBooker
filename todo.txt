General:

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a constant size)

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

store the start and ends in the order as string aswell as the start and end index

test interval finding
use up the first few months
use up the last few months
use up multiple months in the middle
use one 150m length boat to fill up a month

Turn the date to index method into a static one in the timestamp class

comment the testAllDelete method


Simulation:

set ListItems vector back to private (after testing deletes)

use a linked list to store the marina boats
make a new traversal (within the new month method), that goes through each boat
how can I do this by adding new boats into the linked list (more than the first instantiation takes)
watch a video on c++ linked list implementation

Remove boats all boats that need to leave, before adding any new boats

Output the length left per month

Have LinkedList.AddItem() take in a boat, and in that method, push back a new ListItem(passed in boat)
this is for memory management
