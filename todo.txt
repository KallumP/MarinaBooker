General:

make sure that all inputs are number values

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a constant size)

use getline to get an input with spaces in it

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

check for leading 0s in the date input (making the order (start and end) and the delete order)

write to/read from file



Simulation:

Remove boats all boats that need to leave, before adding any new boats

Output the length left per month

Have LinkedList.AddItem() take in a boat, and in that method, push back a new ListItem(passed in boat)
this is for memory management
