General:

make sure that all inputs are number values

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a cosntant size)

make a method that outputs the entered values of the current order
check if a value is empty before outputting it

use getline to get an input with spaces in it

When an order is done, it should output an order number 
which will be used for deleting

check for leading 0s in the date input (making the order (start and end) and the delete order)



Simulation:

Remove boats all boats that need to leave, before adding any new boats

Output the length left per month

in the linked list, don't have all the computations in the if statements
some elses dont' need to check if they belong after (since its the only option left)

Have LinkedList.AddItem() take in a boat, and in that method, push back a new ListItem(passed in boat)
this is for memory management
