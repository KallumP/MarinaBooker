General:

make sure that all inputs are number values

When asking for a time to order, get the interval they want to order within (done)
Ask for the start month that is within the start and the end of the chosen 
and then ask for the end month that is within the start and then end of the chosen interval
For the timestamp, save a string of the time name in the format "mm/yyyy", which will be used to show the user what time intervals can be orderd

separate the time gathering one into a few different methods
showing / gathering the available times to book
getting the time interval they want to book within
getting the start month
getting the end month

add a way to exit the program when in any of the stages

make sure that string inputs are not too long (check against a cosntant size)



Information section:
