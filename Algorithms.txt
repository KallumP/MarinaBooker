Getting the dates for a new order:

Loop1 through each month and checks the length left in the marina per month

If the length left is bigger than the length of the new boat, start a new loop2

Loop2 through the months starting from the next month from the one we just found

Do this until a month is found where there is not enough space in the marina for the new boat

Once this month was found, save the loop1i and loop2j into a timestampindex object and push it to the list of foundintervals
The object holding the start and end months is called an interval (which the user will later choose to book within)

Once the final interval was found (if loop2 does not find any end months, then just take the final month from the timestamp list)
output them all and ask the use what interval they want to book within.

Pass the chosen interval into the ChooseFirstMonth method and ask them what month they want to choose from.

Find out how many months the user can book for by taking the chosen start month and finding the difference from the interval's end month

Ask the user how many months the want to book for. and then push the interval to the current order.
