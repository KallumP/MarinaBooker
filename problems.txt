turning currentorders into a struct rather than it being a class

using a struct of a month start and end, which allows me to return two values from the get ordertime function
this also allows me to store the start and end times that are available in one vector

I didn't define the constructors in the structs

instead of passing a value from method to method, I have made one global variable of a struct that can be edited by each method until 
the end where it gets pushed on to the end of a vector as an order

When getting the start date of a user's order, I started with asking them what interval they wanted to order for. I then asked for their end date.
(assuming that they wanted the first month from the interval they choose) This method was obviously wrong so I needed a way to set the date of each 
time stamp, and ask the user what date they wanted from the interval they choose.

I will set the date of each time stamp to take their respective date at the start of the program.
This way, when outputting order values, it does not need to do any computations, it just outputs a string that it was assigned 
to at the start of the program. The time will be stored in a mm/yyyy format
